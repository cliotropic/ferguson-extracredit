ferguson-extracredit
====================

Extra credit assignments on Ferguson, Missouri, for a fully-online US History survey course.

These are designed to drop into Blackboard with relatively little cut-and-paste work. You'll need a Markdown editor like [Mou](http://25.io/mou/) to convert the *.md files to HTML.

PLEASE NOTE:

* These files contain links which point to a library proxy server at my institution. You should search all links for "fiu" to find them and replace them with appropriate resources at your own institution.

If you have modifications or expansions of these files, feel free to fork this repository and send me a pull request.
