## Think about Historical Parallels:

Consider what you’ve learned about the role of careful organization, leadership, and historical context for the African-American civil rights movement between 1865 and 1970. Consider also historian Mary Dudziak's ideas that the African-American civil rights movement was interlinked with the global Cold War. 

In addition to the work you did for Paper 3, explore the following people, organizations, ideas, and events. For some of these, your textbook will be helpful; others will require more independent research. 1.	African-American churches2.	African-American veterans’ clubs and gun clubs3.	Populism (1890s) and Farmers’ Alliances4.	Anti-lynching movement5.	Double V Movement6.	Emmett Till / Mamie Till Mobley    a.
